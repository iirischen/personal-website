  <p> Hi everyone! My name is Iris Chen and I am 17 years old. I was born in Taiwan and moved to America 
      when I was 4 years old. I didn't know a single word in English and now that I look back I did not know how I did it. 
      I lived in Fresno, California for almost 9 years until one day a family emergency happened and we had to move all 
      the way to Irvine, California. I definitely felt scared being the "new kid" in school however there were a group of 
      amazing girls who came up to me and made me feel welcomed and I now call them my best friends.
      <div>
        I am very new to computer science and 
      I hope I can use what I learned from Girls Who Code and apply it to my path on becoming a game developer.
