   <p class="intro-text"> Hi everyone! My name is Iris Chen and I am 17 years old. I was born in Taiwan and moved to America when I was 4 years old. I didn't know a single word in 
      English and when I look back on it I did not know how I did it. I lived in Fresno, California for almost 9 years until one day a family emergency happened
      and we had to move all the way to Irvine, California. I definitely felt scared being the "new kid" in school however there was a group of amazing girls 
      who came up to me and made me feel welcomed and I now call them my best friends. <br> <br> I love all kinds of food but my absolute favorite is Mexican food. I also LOVE going on boba runs. 
      Some of my favorite things to do is go to the beach, hang out with friends, and play video games. During my free time, I like to watch Netflix and Youtube, and I also try to work 
      out as much as I can during quarantine. <br> <br> I am very new to computer science and I hope I can use what I learn from Girls Who Code and apply it to my dream on becoming a game developer. </p>
