   <p> Hi everyone! My name is Iris Chen and I am 17 years old. I was born in Taiwan and moved to America when<br>I was 4 years old. I didn't know a single word in 
      English and when I look back on it I did not know how I did <br> it. I lived in Fresno, California for almost 9 years until one day a family emergency happened
      and we had to move <br> all the way to Irvine, California. I definitely felt scared being the "new kid" in school however there was a group<br>of amazing girls 
      who came up to me and made me feel welcomed and I now call them my best friends. <br> <br> I am very new to computer science and I hope I can use what I learned from 
      Girls Who Code and apply it to my <br>path on becoming a game developer.</p>
